# EduBridge
Developing a comprehensive student data management system using the MERN stack (ReactJS, NodeJS Express, JWT, MongoDB) to provide secure access, record maintenance, and facility management capabilities.

Key Features:

Comprehensive Student Database: Designed and implemented a secure MongoDB database to store and manage student records, including personal information, grades, and attendance.

Robust Authentication: Utilized JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure user authentication and authorization. Implemented different roles (students, teachers, administrators) with varying access levels.

Seamless User Interface: Built a user-friendly ReactJS frontend for students to easily access their data, check cafeteria schedules and menus, and manage their accounts.

Efficient Facility Management: Integrated functionalities for tracking mess/canteen facilities, managing availability, and allowing students to book slots.

Enhanced Teacher Support: Provided teachers with dedicated sections to view student grades, update marks, and access relevant student information.
